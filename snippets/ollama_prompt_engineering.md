Solve the problem with python3 code. Do it following PEP 8 styling convention, and including Typing hints.

In a first explanation section, provide me with pytest unit tests cases that are relevant, and tell me why they are relevant. Include 5 test cases total. Be concise on the explanation.

In a second explanation section, provide me with a formatted response with the format I will give you. Make it less than 200 words for each section.
